# visual-argument
For my visual argument, I want to convey the benefits of using electric vehicles over gas vehicles. The image on the left illustrates a dark world that is consumed with pollution. The image on the right is much brighter: the grass is green, the sky is blue. I want people to see what our world will look like if we continue to use gas vehicles, and what the world could look like if we switched to electric vehicles. I wanted to make it as appealing to as many people as possible so there is really no obvious political stance in this visual argument; it just shows the truth and reality of our current world.
